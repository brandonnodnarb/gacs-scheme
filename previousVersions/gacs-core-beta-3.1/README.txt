This is the GACS Core Beta 3.1 release.
It contains the following RDF/SKOS files:

gacs-core-beta-3.1.ttl		Concept scheme using Turtle syntax.
gacs-core-beta-3.1.rdf		Same as above, but uses RDF/XML syntax.

You should only need either .ttl or .rdf

The files contain parts that were previously distributed separately:
- SKOS Core and SKOS XL labels
- original scientific names (with @zxx-x-taxon language tag)
- expanded scientific names in many Latin alphabet languages
- thematic groups
- Agrisemantics vocabulary with class and property definitions

In future GACS Core versions some of these parts may again be split out.
